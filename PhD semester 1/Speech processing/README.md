In case of digit recognition, extract the digit folder from 196101005_digit.rar - it will have only text files. The folder of wav digit files has the corresponding .wav files. Extract these files and merge it into 196101005_digit folder. This will be the final dataset for digit recognition. Then extract 196101005_digitRecognition. In its folder, go to ./196101005_digitRecognition/assignment5/assignment5 and paste the final 196101005_digit folder there. After that, you can run the code.
